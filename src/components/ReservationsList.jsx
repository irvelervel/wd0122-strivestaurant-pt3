// we're still going to use a class for this component
// because we need the state, but also because we're going to fetch some data:
// fetching data for feeding a component MUST BE DONE in a specific spot
// and that spot is available JUST on class components!

import { Component } from 'react'
import { ListGroup, Spinner, Alert } from 'react-bootstrap'
// import ListGroup from 'react-bootstrap/ListGroup'
// this way would be the preferred one

// 1) we're going to create an empty state, for holding the reservations at a later point
// 2) create a binding, a connection between the STATE and the INTERFACE (the render() method)
// 3) now we have to fill the state! we have to fetch the reservations list and use this.setState to put them into the state
// 4) let's NOT launch our fetchReservations() function from render()... because render() fires again at every state change!
// 5) we should find a method that is guaranteed to be executed JUST ONCE!
// 6) that method is called componentDidMount, and if present, will be executed after the initial render() invokation!

// - first render invocation takes into the page the static elements: the title, the empty list, the side components
// - after the first render, componentDidMount gets executed automatically (if present!)
// - componentDidMount takes care of executing the fetch() because it's guaranteed to NOT be executed again!
// - after getting the data from the API, componentDidMount usually sets the state with the data
// - after setting the state, render() wakes up automatically and fires again. this time, the state is filled with the data!
